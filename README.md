## DESCRIPTION OF TASK

In this task, I deployed a simple microservice using Kubernetes on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu. I installed Minikube and Kubernetes tools (`kubectl`) on the EC2 instance to simulate a local cluster.

As part of the deployment, I used Nginx as the containerized service. First, I created a pod definition in `nginx-pod.yaml`, which runs an `nginx:latest` image exposing port 80. Then, I exposed this pod using a NodePort service defined in `nginx-service.yaml` that maps to port 30080.

To verify deployment, I checked the pod and service using `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get svc`. I then forwarded the Nginx service to port 8080 of the EC2 instance using `kubectl port-forward`, making it accessible from my browser using the public EC2 IP (`http://<public-ip>:8080`).

I also modified the Nginx HTML page by executing into the pod using `kubectl exec`, and updated the welcome page with a personalized message.

This task helped me understand the deployment of containerized applications using YAML manifests, service exposure methods, port forwarding, and accessing pods from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

## HOW TO RUN

1. Apply pod and service:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
    kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
    ```

2. Forward port (from EC2):
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward pod/nginx-pod 8080:80 --address=0.0.0.0
    ```

3. Access in browser:
    ```
    http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080
    ```

4. Edit welcome page:
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it nginx-pod -- bash
    echo "<h1>Hello, my name is Omkar</h1>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    ```
